<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve ordered your favorite foods from your favorite restaurants and exhausted the exorbitant list of exceptional offerings that Mr. Delivery can deliver right to your door, you may start to think of ways that YOU could improve how we do business. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HELL YES. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We LOVE this kind of feedback. Especially when it comes to suggestions for new restaurants to add. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, say there is a restaurant that you are dying to have deliver to you but Mr. Delivery does not offer that restaurant on our website. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we wish we could partner with every restaurant in the world, each restaurant added is a relationship fostered that takes time and effort. It’s a rewarding process, and it is one that we work even harder at when our loyal fans are the ones demanding a new addition. If our customers demand it, we will work our hardest to get the restaurant on board. </span>
