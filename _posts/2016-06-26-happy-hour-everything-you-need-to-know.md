The idea mostly just meant drinking before dinner, but the concept was involved in many historic events. Gaining traction ironically during the Prohibition Era, this ideology may actually have been one of the most important aspects in our nation's history. To this day, Happy Hour is still notoriously blacklisted from many venues and even states. Massachusetts banned Happy Hour in 1984, along with a couple other states. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen...literally.

While you may think this concept began at your local <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/chilis-east-menu/835/53716" target="_blank">Chili's</a> a couple years back, Happy Hour actually dates back to King Henry in 1599. He was heard saying, "Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition . . . ." While some protested against this Hour of Happy, the term challenged them all by doing its public service and joining our military. The US Navy adopted the phrase in 1913 aboard the USS Arkansas. Not to take away from the Civil Rights Movement, but at that time, a phrase like that being allowed to join the military was unprecedented.

Because of its checkered past, many look down upon thus hour. Happy Hour has always been resilient though and fights til the very last minute. Like Mike Tyson, Jack Bauer, or any other controversial good-natured entity. So now you know. Now you know that your low-priced drinks and appetizers are more than just a social outing. It rings patriotism and justice to its core. Many people still want to know what freedom tastes like? Well now you can tell them, it tastes like discounted jalapeno poppers and luke-warm Budlight.

Except in Massachusetts, where freedom tastes like full priced <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/fat-sandwich-co-menu/1308" target="_blank">jalapeno poppers</a> and luke-warm Budlight.
