<div class="paragraph">National restaurant chains, P.F. Chang’s and Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, have agreed to a partnership with the Mr. Delivery service. Why are so many big companies within the food industry flocking to hand off their delivery woes to third-party services? With a no-risk partnership agreement, you can’t blame the majority of restaurants for making the switch. Mr. Delivery leads the pack right now in front of other competing delivery services, Postmates and Favor.
Another huge blow to both Favor and Postmates, these two restaurants are bringing with them a large customer base. Widely accepted as the king of national chinese eateries, P.F. Chang’s will boost the already large Mr. Delivery menu options. Dickey’s will also provide more claim to their southern foothold with another BBQ partnerships.
Their steady growth in the industry hasn’t been quiet and they’ve managed to claim a large stake by competing in over 25+ cities nationally. Most restaurants argue that Mr. Delivery’s customer satisfaction record and marketing projections is what was most convincing. Companies are loving these easy-to-work with delivery softwares too. Not only do they take care of the physical aspects, but all the marketing as well. Both small and large companies were especially loving the new Mr. Delivery app and online menusoftware.
Not only is online ordering controlling a huge section of the market, but the new apps are gaining an extreme amount of popularity. In the ever-changing food industry, companies have to pay attention to the growing trends and ways of ordering. They are realizing who ever controls the easiest way to order, will control most of the consumers.</div>
