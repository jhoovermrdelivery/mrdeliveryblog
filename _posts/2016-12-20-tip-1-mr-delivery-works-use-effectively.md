<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with how the Mr. Delivery process works and how get the most out of your delivery options. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When entering <a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com">mrdelivery.com</a> or ordering through our mobile app, go ahead and type in your address that you want to deliver to and our website will let you know if you are within our delivery zone. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your address is submitted, choose from one of our many different restaurants in your market and begin to browse the menu and add items to your cart. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can customize your order as you please with various options and special requests. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your order has been completed, you will get a notification from us letting you know that your order is on your way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are having any problems with your order, you can message us directly on our website or give us a call on our Contact Us page. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy enough, right?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the extra step to make it easier by creating your account when you place your order. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating an account, you can store your information with us so every time you place an order, you won’t have to fill out all of the same information. With an account, you can add an address and your payment information to your profile, and our secure system will allow you to track your orders and earn reward points. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Mr. Delivery account grants you access to exclusive emails with the latest deals, Mr. Delivery news, and our fun and informative blogs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve got the order process down (and maybe even created an account so you place orders faster than your co-workers), enjoy the stunned looks as your Mr. Delivery driver drops off the best food in your area without you moving an inch. </span>
