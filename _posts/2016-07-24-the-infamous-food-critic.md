The Yelp Critic, made famous by South Park's episode <a href="http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s19e04-youre-not-yelping">You're not Yelping</a>, is a person that independently reviews restaurants for business rating sites like Yelp. Is this just a myth or do people actually review restaurants in an attempt for better service? Honolulu Magazine recently just posted <a href="http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/August-2011/9-Things-Hawaii-Chefs-Wished-You-Knew/index.php?cparticle=4&amp;siarticle=3#artanc">9 Things Hawaii Chefs Wished You Knew</a> and #8 is titled <em>You are not actually a Food Critic. </em>Needless to say "Yelpers" did not take too kindly to this opinion and ironically posted to Yelp about it (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/topic/honolulu-who-said-im-not-a-food-critic-you-have-got-to-read-this-yelpers">Yelp post</a>).

Have Yelpers truly become a new breed or is it just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gordon+ramsey&amp;rlz=1CALEAE_enUS673US673&amp;oq=gordon+ramsey&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2296j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Gordon Ramsay</a> behind a computer? In an <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/10/28/why-yelp-restaurant-reviews-arent-trustworthy/">article</a> by The Federalist, one waitress claims many people hide their emotions and say they're satisfied in the restaurant until they go home to their computer to recount a different story. Many times it is not just independent Yelpers too, occasionally it will be competitor reviews trying to mess with online ratings of rival businesses.

Either way, Yelp has become a controversial topic lately. As always, many advise to use information you find on the internet sparingly and that you can only be the true judge of your food. You can order that critically-acclaimed food straight to your door with <a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com">Mr. Delivery</a>.
