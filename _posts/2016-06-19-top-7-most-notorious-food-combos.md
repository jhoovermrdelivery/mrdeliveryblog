<h2 class="wsite-content-title">If you know anyone pregnant, it is probably in their best interest that you forward them this article. Below we have a list of the weirdest, but most popular food combinations. The foods beloved by the silent majority of food lovers everywhere. Check out some of the more persuasive meal combinations below.




1. PB&amp;J with doritos in the middle

<a href="http://blog.mrdelivery.com/carpe-delivery-tweatmrdelivery/previous/www.mrdelivery.com">Depends on which dorito flavor, but even most of them we wouldn’t judge… Have your local deli or convenience store conjure this up and get your food easily delivered to you through our ordering page.</a> #MrDeliveryExperiments
Cheese pizza with chocolate


2. The Chocolate Pizza

<a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/draft-pick-menu/307" target="_blank">The chocolate and cheese combo has never seemed so tempting before. But the only way you could experiment with this is exclusively through your favorite pizza. Draft Pick serves a cheese pizza worthy of this task and we could even get it straight to your door within 45 min. #SeizeTheDay #CarpeDiem #MrDeliveryExperiments</a>


3. Fries and honey

<a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/mcdonalds-menu/695" target="_blank">     Apparently, you do catch more FRIES with honey than vinager! French fries literally just got a little bit healthier and classier. Mcdonald’s can make you a fry perfect for the taste test. Don’t miss out. #MrDeliveryExperiments</a>



4. Popcorn with ketchup

<a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/mr-delivery-app" target="_blank">    Might as well add some mustard at this point. One of the more simpler recipes to make, but we suggest stocking up on the superior popcorn and ketchup brands anyways. Search up your local stores through our Mr. Delivery App! </a>



5. Popcorn and marshmallows

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mr+delivery+phone+number&amp;rlz=1CALEAE_enUS673US673&amp;oq=mr+delivery+phone+number&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59.4640j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">     Might as well even add some marshmallows...oh wait we just did. This also sounds good without the added cashews and m&amp;m’s portrayed in the picture. Call in and have us pick up your favorites from the local market. </a>



6. Rice with ketchup

<a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/pf-changs-menu/879" target="_blank">    I feel it wouldn’t look as tempting as this picture is making it out to be… Either way, we know many people that enjoy this acquired taste. Have this now though your favorite rice dishes from your local P.F. Changs restaurant! </a>



7. Peanut butter hamburger

Hmmmmm interesting...very interesting. If you have the night to yourself tonight, I would suggest making it memorable by experimenting with this. You can order your burger easily and under budget through our ordering page and app! <a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com/">www.mrdelivery.com</a></h2>
