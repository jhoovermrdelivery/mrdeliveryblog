It’s 2017. You know that marketing is important. Or at least you might’ve heard something about the importance of people knowing about your restaurant. You’re reading this, so you at least understand that the more people that know what you offer and how they can purchase it, the better off both parties are.

&nbsp;

That’s where Mr. Delivery comes in. As the name suggests, we do help restaurants like you with deliveries, working to coordinate drivers and bring food from restaurants to the homes and offices of millions of hungry people nationwide. But we don’t think of ourselves as your standard delivery service, and you shouldn’t either.

&nbsp;

The biggest aspect of Mr. Delivery, and the main reason our restaurants enjoy increased sales and success, is our investment in marketing and technology that makes your offerings accessible to nearly anyone in your area. We consistently upgrade and enhance our in-house offerings to allow for the best web and mobile experiences. This means your customers will have access to easy-to-use apps on their phones, a simple web portal for tracking orders and managing points, and you’ll have the ability to control your menu offerings throughout the entire process.

That’s pretty cool, right? But, say you aren’t as tech-y or your audience would prefer to just call in their orders? Our marketing team kicks ass at this as well. Every restaurant partner gets a comprehensive marketing kit that is suited to your needs. This includes window stickers, branded delivery bags, and, most importantly, menu guides. Our menu guides are sent to your entire area, loaded with choice items that your customers can quickly order with a phone call to our dedicated call center.

&nbsp;

The point is, don’t get hung up in the idea that we’re just bringing your food to people, because we want to do so much more for you. We want to plaster your logo on every space possible and send it out to your whole town! We want people to call in knowing their regular orders with your restaurant because they can’t turn around without seeing something with your logo on it and they can’t open their phones without an email or social posting reminding them that you’re open and delivering some of the best offerings in town.
