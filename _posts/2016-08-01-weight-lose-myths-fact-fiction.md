Going cold turkey from fattening foods by actually eating cold turkey? We all have heard more than enough weight loss diets and tips. Stop eating cold turkey for a second and lets see if all these weight loss ideas can withstand the heat!

<strong>Eliminating Entire Food Groups</strong>

"I am cutting out sugar from my diet!" Yes some food groups are worse than others, but eliminating them completely for long-term periods can be very dangerous. Sugar and grains are the most common groups eliminated, but eating these in moderation is far more healthy for your body. Not only that, but you are subjecting yourself to insane cravings that you are more likely to break on. You can find more balanced meals at restaurants like <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/qdoba-menu/294">Qdoba</a> or <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/pad-thai-menu/271">Pad Thai</a>. Ethnic cuisines like Mexican and Thai have a variety of healthy vegetables, light grains, and lean proteins.

<strong>Working Out While Hungry</strong>

While this one may seem like the best way to maximize your weight loss, you are actually not doing much for yourself. With little food for your body to draw fuel from, you will instead be burning muscle instead of fat. You will be able to confirm this by how drained your body feels after that workout. Eating regularly portioned meals before workouts will help you not only burn fat instead of muscle, but let you perform longer workouts too. Diners like <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/dennys-menu/137">Denny's</a> and <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/b-town-diner-menu/68">B-Town Diner</a> can provide you will single serving food groups to help you efficiently power through your workout.

<strong>Avoiding Breakfast</strong>

This one has been famously debunked in that past, but surprisingly it is still pretty common. Whether its purposely done or just due to lack of time, you need to remember that breakfast is still the most important meal of the day. A high protein breakfast is the best way to go as a study found that people who ate eggs in the morning lost double the amount of weight as people who ate just a bagel. <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/eatn-park---menu/1701">Eat'n Park</a> and <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/urbana-garden-restaurant--menu/701">Urbana Garden Restaurant</a> have classic breakfast items like specialty omelettes to get you through the day.
