You already know this, but it’s that time of year when many of us promise ourselves that we are going to be better this year than we were last year. Some of us succeed, some of us succumb to our old habits. But Mr. Delivery can actually help out in this regard.

This year’s most popular resolutions were:
<ul>
 	<li>Get Healthy</li>
 	<li>Get Organized</li>
 	<li>Live Life to the Fullest</li>
 	<li>Learn New Hobbies</li>
 	<li>Spend Less/Save More</li>
 	<li>Travel</li>
 	<li>Read More</li>
</ul>
Now, how does Mr. Delivery help? Obviously we can help bring healthy food to you, help you stay organized with the ability to plan your orders ahead of time, and of course we are always trying to save you money, but what about the other resolutions?

I’ll give you a personal example. I used to read all the time. I mean like 16-17 books in a Summer was a no brainer. Then, I became a writer and my reading rate dropped to just above zero (not counting online articles and the mindless social banter we read daily). So I made it a goal last year to read one book per month. Not a big challenge, but I still fell short.

This year, I made the same resolution, but I’ve found a better way to stick to it: fill time voids and waiting periods by reading. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 45 minutes, doesn’t matter. Just pick up the damn book and read until that time period is over.

If I had read for thirty minutes every time I waited on a delivery order in 2016, I guarantee I would’ve hit my monthly goal. And you can to. Use the time between placing your order and our driver showing up at your door to do something about your resolutions.

You wanted to learn a new hobby? Spend 30 minutes reading about it, watching tutorials, trying it out, etc.

You wanted to get organized? Spend 30 minutes organizing one specific area of your house or apartment.

Or, if you’re like me and you wanted to read more, keep a book handy and commit to reading while you wait for your food.

Don’t wait. Start now. Place your <a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com">order</a> and start that 30-minute timer.
