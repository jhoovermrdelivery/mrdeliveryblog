The country sits on the edge of its seat to determine a winner of the national food delivery race (much like the "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=space+race&amp;rlz=1CALEAE_enUS673US673&amp;oq=space+race&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5253j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">space race</a>"). This industry has been competitive and has taken no prisoners. Through all this, Mr. Delivery has prevailed as a national front-runner with no slowing down in sight. Our exponential growth has gained the support of many community leaders across the country.

While we already have the support of the <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/restaurants/bloomington-food-delivery">Bloomington, Indiana</a> community, we decided not to sell ourselves short. We will soon be announcing the launch of our new market in Bloomington, Illinois on July 12th! Eventually we will gain the respect of every Bloomington community across the country and be able to provide their citizens with quality food delivery at affordable prices. The #BloomingtonTakeover has begun people.

We will officially have turf in 22+ cities and am on the verge of becoming an even bigger household name (even if it is because your family dinner was delivered by <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/">Mr. Delivery</a>)! Where will we post-up next you might ask? Take part in the #MrDeliveryCommunity and share the next area we should lock down.
