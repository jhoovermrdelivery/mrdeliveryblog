<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Are you like us, and spend most of your day thinking about food or celebrities? That makes sense, because indulging in simple joys like Cher or mac n’ cheese lights up the happy corner of our brains. And that makes the world a fuzzier, creamier place. (Sorry, our thesaurus is currently on loan.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part is when food and celebrities come together. Which is why we compiled a list of food doppelgangers for your viewing pleasure.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Channing Tatum &amp; Potato</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.35.03-PM.png" width="1060" height="576" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’ll start it off with an obvious pair. Bet we weren’t the only ones watched Magic Mike and thought “Wow, that’s a talented potato,” the whole time. It wasn’t until the credits rolled that we realized our mistake. Also, did you know that the movie was based on much of potato’s Channing’s real life and rise to stardom? Much like another famous potato we knew. (link to potato sam}</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Rihanna &amp; Omelette</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.35.09-PM.png" width="1218" height="440" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We don’t know much about fashion, but if someone shows up to an awards event looking like an omelette, we remember it. Rihanna is a true chameleon who can adapt to any genre, culture, and breakfast food. “We Found Love in a Broken Egg” might just be our favorite song.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Grimace McDonaldland &amp; Eggplant</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.35.29-PM.png" width="988" height="690" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’re not saying Grimace is an eggplant, we’re just saying nobody has ever seen him and an eggplant in a room together. So either McDonald’s doesn’t serve any eggplant burgers “by pure coincidence” or they’re in the final stages of building a Frankenstein vegetable arm. Also we just learned that Grimace’s legal last name is McDonaldland.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Dame Judi Dench &amp; Banana</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.35.34-PM.png" width="1096" height="742" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Speaking of fresh produce, we couldn’t believe what we saw at the store yesterday: one of our top ten actresses (and top one dame) Judi Dench, sitting on a pile of bananas. But then we realized we didn’t have our glasses on. It was only a normal banana and everything made sense again. (Where can we get a pita pocket clutch like Judi?)</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Gerard Depardieu &amp; Dinner Roll</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.35.40-PM.png" width="1098" height="494" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Did you know that Gerard is one of the most prolific actors in film history, having been in like, 170 movies? But we bet that Bread Roll has been in even more films, because everyone wants a piece of it. There’s no doubt that once we publish this post, producers from far and wide will be calling up Bread and offering it the hottest leading roles. Mmm….rolls…</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Harry Styles &amp; Cupcake</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.36.10-PM.png" width="1118" height="622" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Admit it, we just blew your mind. Harry and this cupcake were definitely twins separated at birth. So they aren’t identical, but you can’t deny the resemblance. Now that the secret’s out, how long do you think it will take to make the Lifetime movie of their story “I Was A Teenage Cupcake: Diary of a Pomade Addict”?</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Odell Beckham Jr. &amp; Cupcake</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.36.18-PM.png" width="1196" height="558" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If these two stood next to each other, we honestly couldn’t tell who was who. Both have this gravity-defying way of catching our eye. The trick to distinguishing between the two is, if you’re on a football field, it’s probably Odell.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sinéad Marie Bernadette O’Connor &amp; Unfrosted Vanilla Bernadette Cupcake</b></span></h3>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.36.24-PM.png" width="1108" height="462" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Traits Sinead and this cupcake have in common: Both look beautiful without frosting. Both are ISTP according to Myers–Briggs. Traits Sinead and this cupcake do not have in common: Only Sinead has eyebrows. Only the cupcake has gluten.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Honorable Mentions:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Young Joe Biden &amp; Snickerdoodle</b></span></p>
<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://blog.eat24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.36.31-PM.png" width="1140" height="614" />
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">…Sorry, what? What’s going on? We got distracted. This always happens when we look for images of young Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This last doppelganger’s image is a little bit…sensitive. If you’re under 18, pregnant, or scared of the dark, now’s the time to click away and go about the rest of your internet business.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, if you think you can handle our last honorable mention, scroll down…</span></p>
