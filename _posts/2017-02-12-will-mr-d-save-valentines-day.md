<strong>So you’ve got a date and dropped the ball on making plans…No Sweat!</strong>

Clock’s ticking and you’ve got less than 24 hours to get that special someone something special, and maybe make some special arrangements as well.

&nbsp;

Did you know you can preorder your Valentine’s Day Dinner <a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com"><u>right now</u></a>? Just decide whether you would like to enjoy Burgers for Two or Fine Dining at Casa de You, we’ve got you covered.

&nbsp;

Here’s the plan. Pick where you’ll be having your date tomorrow. Pick the restaurant you’d like to enjoy. Pick the time you want to have your date. Select the items for your meal. Now, you’re all set. Spend the rest of that 24 hours finding something special for that special someone, and we will take care of dinner!

&nbsp;

<strong>You’re an independent person that don’t need no date? Why not plan ahead!</strong>
