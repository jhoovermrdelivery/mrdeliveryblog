Change isn’t easy. Jobs, clients, partners, employees, prices….you name it, change affects us all differently, but especially when it comes to your business and your bottom line, you always try to do what’s best. Which is why, when it comes to your decision to work with Mr. Delivery, it’s not an easy one.

&nbsp;

Sure, as a national brand with national resources, we can provide you with a heaping pile of marketing materials and branded “swag” to hand out, we can take over for that pesky dispatcher you can’t seem to get in line, and we can iron out all of your technical solutions, but at the end of the day, we are offering a big change. And there’s more to Mr. Delivery than the very tangible benefits we offer.

&nbsp;

I’ll give you an example as a franchisee that recently took that plunge and accepted the change that Mr. Delivery would bring and has brought. We’d been in similar talks before with other national groups, first when some local rivals looked ripe for the taking and again when a national chain set up shop and then all but stopped operating a few months later. We were pretty confident that we knew what we were doing.

&nbsp;

Admittedly, we had our limits. Our marketing department was comprised of me. I was the email marketer. I was the social marketer. I was the graphic designer. I was the reporter and press agent. I was the guy making menu guides and working with the post office to get them out. Personally, I saw a lot of opportunity in the simple marketing offerings that Mr. Delivery would offer. But before we could decide if the benefits of the partnership would be worth it, my partner and I had to decide if Mr. Delivery and the change needed in the interim would be worth it.

&nbsp;

This isn’t something that can be itemized and put on an agenda for a conference call, as much as some of us would like that. We had to physically come out to Austin. Physically be in the dispatching room, talking to members of the Mr. D team, shaking hands with the people we would later be working with day in and day out.

&nbsp;

In fact, in one of these meetings, we were asked what other materials or paperwork or samples we could be shown to further convince us that this was the right choice. At the time, we said “We just want to see how work, works on a daily basis.” After street tacos, BBQ and some time walking round Downtown Austin, it really came down to everything that <em>wasn’t</em> prepared for the franchisee.

&nbsp;

So, If I can make a personal recommendation during your consideration process, it would be this: Pay heed to what is shown to you (duh, it’s important or we wouldn’t waste your time), but really pay heed to what <em>isn’t</em> shown to you. And by that I don’t mean to insinuate we’re hiding anything, but rather that our day-to-day activities and interactions, and the people that are essential to those moments, will have a bigger impact on your decision.

&nbsp;

Speaking personally, the benefits were great, but if I didn’t feel comfortable with the team in those day-to-day, unplanned, spontaneous and sometimes dreadful situations, we wouldn’t have made the change. But we did. Because Mr. Delivery offers more than just what we say, we offer everything. We are your <em>partner</em>; we <em>share</em> in your rise and fall, and that’s why we will do what we can, beyond what we say, to ensure your partnership with us as a Mr. Delivery Franchisee will be the best move you can make towards a better future for your company and your market.

&nbsp;

If you’d like to set up a time to be here and live the Mr. Delivery life for a few days before you make that decision, please <u><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/franchise">let us know</a>.</u>
