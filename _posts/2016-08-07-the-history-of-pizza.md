The combination of bread, sauce, and cheese is ironically often considered Italy's greatest creation. The simplicity of this recipe caught on in Naples during the 1700s as a cheap and quick way to enjoy a meal. What started as street vendors selling flatbread with different toppings has turned into an art-form of many cities and cultures. It was officially an Italian dish when it was named to honor the Queen consort of Italy in 1889. The first official US pizzeria began at Lombardi's on Spring St, New York in 1905. After that, New Yorkers cheered as they could finally walk, eat, and curse people out all at the same time.

Chicago's deep dish style pizza was reportedly created by Chicago's own Pizzeria Uno in 1943. Quickly dismissed by New Yorkers for having to use a fork and knife while eating it, a feud began. The feud continues on as thin-crust lovers argue convenience as an important aspect since pizza's inception and deep dish fans preach the unique crust and huge serving size. Whatever your opinion, there is no perfect time for pizza like the present. Below are a list of some of Mr. Delivery's most popular Pizzas.
