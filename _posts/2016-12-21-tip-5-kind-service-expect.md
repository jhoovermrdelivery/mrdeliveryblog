<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only one kind of service that you can expect from the team at Mr. Delivery, and that’s exceptional service. From start to finish, we work tirelessness to connect with you as real people talking to real people. No bots, no answering machines, pre-made messages, no bulls***.</span>

Through accidents, heavy traffic, harsh weather and even vehicle break downs, our team strives to get your order to you no matter what, because we understand that hunger doesn’t care if the forecast said “Sunny” and it’s pouring down rain. </span>
