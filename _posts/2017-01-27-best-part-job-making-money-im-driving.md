For some of us, there’s just something about cruising around town that is good for the soul. We’re the road warriors. With our music and talk radio turned up and a tank full of gas, we’re happy as a hog in shit if we never have to put it in park. Sound familiar?

&nbsp;

Then let me introduce Anthony Keene, one of the awesome Mr. Delivery drivers from Bloomington, IN who found a place for his road warrior spirit and got paid to do so!

<blockquote><em>Anthony: I personally like to go out and drive amongst my town and Mr. Delivery gives me the opportunity to make money while I do that. That is the best part of my job: making money while I’m driving.</em>

<em> </em>

<em>A: If I run into an issue with a customer not answering the phone or a wrong address, I immediately reach out to the call center either by phone call or text and usually they are right on it. They are there to help you; you don’t feel alone when you’re out here driving.</em>

<em> </em>

<em>A: The customers ordered through Mr. Delivery because we have a reputation. 99.9% of the responses I get are “That was fast.” We kind of have a reputation to uphold with Mr. Delivery, and we’re doing that each day.</em>

<em> </em>

<em>A: This is one of the best companies that I have ever worked for. And I recommend that if you have a chance to work for Mr. Delivery, you should jump on it, because I’m glad that I did.</em></blockquote>
&nbsp;

Drivers like Anthony make up a nationwide network of road warriors who bring the best that their towns have to offer right to the homes and offices of their friends and neighbors. If working on your own schedule, having your own mobile office, and getting paid to put rubber to pavement sounds like something you’d be interested in, <a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/drivers">reach out</a> and let’s talk about how we can find a place for you in the Mr. Delivery family.
