<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where it starts to get fun…..setting up your Mr. Delivery account. Your Mr. Delivery experience can only get better with personality! Help us get to know you, and you’ll never have to repeat your delivery info again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add your phone number and birthday for a fun birthday surprise, and input any payment information you’d like saved. The more information about yourself that you add, the more time it saves you, making ordering quick and easy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By managing your account, you can also track your rewards. This is where you’ll receive points for each order you make and allows you to store your information on file for group ordering. </span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start right now! Just go to the “Sign in” button on the top right of the Mr. Delivery website or go to the “account” tab on your mobile app to set your account up. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We promise it will be worth it in the long run, especially when you become a Mr. Delivery fan and your rewards points start stacking up!  </span>
