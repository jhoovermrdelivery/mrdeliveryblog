<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than stare at the door with emerging anticipation and excitement as your order approaches, take advantage of Mr. Delivery’s Order Tracking feature. You can go about your day as normal and check in periodically. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“But how?” A few ways. First, when you successfully place an order, you’ll have the option of opting in to get email notifications as your order is prepared and sent on its way. </span>Already get 1000’s of emails a day and do not have time for that mess? No worries. You can also check your order status directly through the Mr. Delivery website by clicking on the “my orders” tab.
