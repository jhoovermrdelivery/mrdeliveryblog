<span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably remember your last bad hangover, you may even be hungover right now. There are many ways for going about a hangover and we will help you separate fact from fiction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/five-guys-menu/1145">Greasy food</a>, contrary to popular belief, works better BEFORE you start drinking than after. Bloody marys and mimosas, popular hangover drinks, are actually not that good for you as well. Besides drinking more while already hungover, acidic drinks can irritate a sensitive stomach. Don’t worry though, we have a list of safe foods to get rid of that nasty hangover.</span>

...and we can also make sure you get them without having to leave the comfort of your apartment! #HeathlyHangoverFoods #MrDelivery

<b><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/murphys-deli-menu/260">Eggs</a></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What came first, the chicken or the egg? If you're hungover it's eggs. Eggs contain Taurine which helps normal liver functions and prevents liver disease.</span>

&nbsp;

<b><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/thai-kitchen-menu/288">Water-based soups</a></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soup Nazi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Seinfeld would agree that soups like chicken noodle or miso will help repair much needed water and sodium levels. But then he would also say, “No soup for you!” and tell you to get to the back of the line.</span>

&nbsp;

<b><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/barleybean-menu/274">Vegetables</a> </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your mom said “eat your vegetables” she was actually preparing you for hangovers. Its an all-around superfood with too many benefits to count. EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!</span>

&nbsp;

<b><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/fricanos-deli-menu/219">Crackers</a> </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Soak up the midnight tequila with some crackers or bread. Add peanut butter for necessary protein or jelly for an energy boost. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Bananas</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Potassium, found in bananas, is an essential electrolyte often depleted by alcohol.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Dates</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have some dates to go along with your successful date last night. Dates are also high in potassium!</span>

&nbsp;

<b><a href="https://www.mrdelivery.com/order/restaurant/red-mango-menu/1146">Yogurt</a> </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding an appetite for foods is tricky while hungover. A light sweet yogurt can be just as easy to eat as it is good for you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have any of these foods and left all of your energy at the bar last night, you can order any one of these from Mr. Delivery. Quick and easy delivery, makes hangovers a thing of the past. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.mrdelivery.com">www.mrdelivery.com</a> Treat the whole office to hangover food remedies especially after those late night office "gatherings." </span>
