<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a deep breath. We know all of this information can be a bit overwhelming. If you’re having a hard time grasping everything or have a few more questions, you’re not alone. We’ve compiled a list of the most common questions that we get on a daily basis for you to easily refer to here. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>How long does it take to get a delivery?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We shoot for 45-60 mins. Depending on the area, weather, restaurant prep times from time to time we may run behind but do our best to inform you of the situation</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What does it cost?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the area delivery fees can range from $3-$10, and may include a service fee of $1.49. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Can I order from more than one restaurant?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course! (A delivery fee will be charged for each order) </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Can I order beverages?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the beverages are on the menu you are more than welcome to order drinks. If the drinks are not on the menu that particular market or restaurant has decided to exclude drinks for delivery. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Can I order cigarettes or alcohol?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at this time. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Why do I see more than one charge for my order?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you have trouble processing the order and had to submit a second time? You are more than likely seeing a pending charge that will drop off in 24-72 hours depending on whom you bank with.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>My card was charged twice but my order was not placed. What happened?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you have trouble processing the order due to incorrect billing or credit card information. The site has strict billing rule parameters to protect customers and if any information that is provided is incorrect the order will not go through. Depending on whom you bank with you may see pending transactions. These are not real charges and will drop off in 24-72 business hours. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Can I order a special not on the menu?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are happy to ask on your behalf if a restaurant is willing to extend an in house special for delivery, they do reserve the right to say no. Restaurants have to keep a little something special exclusively to get their fans through the doors :-) It’s nothing personal</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Why are the prices different on your menus than in house?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants control the pricing of their delivery menu. From time to time they may decide to vary the prices for the delivery process. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Can I request a driver?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely! We will do our best to accommodate if the driver is on shift. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Do I have to tip?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipping is not required but it is appreciated. The drivers make the majority of their money from tips much like servers. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>How can I redeem my rewards? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MrD rewards one point for every dollar spent. Once you have spent $250 an automatic $5 credit will be applied to your account and will deduct from your next order. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>My order has been marked arrived but it’s still not here? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “arrived” status means that your MrD driver has arrived at the restaurant to pick up your meal. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Why hasn't my order moved from the new status?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do our best to time the driver’s arrival to the restaurant to the restaurant’s time of prep. Sometimes your order will remain in the “New” status until just mns before the driver is on his way to the restaurant. This is to ensure you get your meal fresh and delicious!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Do you have gift cards?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working on this feature- coming very soon!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>How long does a refund take?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Refunds are done in real time on our end. Depending on whom you bank with however it may be up to 5 business days.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>How do I get a coupon?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We give out coupons and various promotions on social media and through weekly emails. Make sure you are signed up on the site to be included :-)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only a few of the questions we get asked every single day. If you don’t see your question on here, feel free to reach out to our awesome team and let us work with you to figure out the answer together. </span>
